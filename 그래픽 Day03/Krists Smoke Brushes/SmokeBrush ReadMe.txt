I hope you enjoy these resources and check out my other resources and my website, 
where I upload more resources as well as other great knowledge. 

To use these brushes, you may need to fix the brush presets for them to work 
as intended. I was having problems with them every now and then.

Once you load the brushes, open the 'Brush' palette to change your brush presets to
the following to get the maximum benefit from these:
(CS4 Settings)

Brush Tip Shape: 'Flip X' and 'Flip Y' both checked
Shape Dynamics: Size Jitter: 100%; Minimum Diameter: 15%; Angle Jitter: 100%; Flip X and Flip Y: checked

Scattering: Scatter: 48%; Count: 3; Counter Jitter: 100%

Other Dynamics: Opacity Jitter: 100%; Flow Jitter: 75%
Smoothing: Checked

**These are of course set by preference, but how they were intended to appear should 
have settings close to these***

*****Also check my other uploaded files for some smoke brushes, 
ember brushes, fire brushes, as well as a great layer style for fire*****
